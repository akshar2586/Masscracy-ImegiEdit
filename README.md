ImegiEdit is a free and open source cross‑platform **photo** and **video** editor built with Flutter.  
It targets Android, iOS, and Windows using a single codebase and focuses on simple, fast editing with no watermarks and no paid features.

## Features (MVP)

Planned for the first public version:

- Photo: Crop, rotate, basic filters, brightness/contrast, text overlay, stickers.
- Video: Trim, crop, rotate, select cover/thumbnail, basic filters, export to MP4.
- Platforms: Android APK, Windows desktop build, and later iOS (TestFlight/App Store).

All code is licensed under the Apache License 2.0.

## Tech stack

- Flutter (Dart) for UI and cross‑platform builds.
- Open source Flutter video editor packages (e.g. `video_editor`) for trimming/cropping.
- FFmpeg integration for video export and effects (planned).
- Pure Dart/Flutter image packages for photo editing.
